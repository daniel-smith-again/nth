How do I contribute?
	Don't.
	I understand this is not the answer you want to hear, but this project
	is only open source, not open everything. You can look at the source. 
	You can do whatever is permissible with the license for the source. 
	You can even fork the project if you want. But I must be expressly clear
	that I don't care about your opinion. I don't care about having a 
	community, team, or "inner circle". No such prestige exists here. The 
	language specification is complete, fixed, and dead for all eternity. 
	All I do here is make that standard into a humble executable for you to
	enjoy.
