How do I contribute?
	Don't. I understand that's not the answer you want to hear, but this 
	project is only open source. You can look at the source. you can do 
	whatever is permissible with the license for the source. You can even
	fork the project if you want. But I must be expressly clear that I
	don't care about your opinion. I don't care about having a community,
	team, or "inner circle". No such prestige exists here. The language
	specification is complete, fixed, and dead for all eternity. All I do 
	here is make that standard into a humble executable for you to enjoy.
