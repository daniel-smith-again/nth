What operations and forms are NOT quantified?
Q represents a quantified sub-program,
(x : T), (x)
What operations are quantified over the sub-program.
{(x : T), (x)}
does this result in a quantification of collections?
What if I want to specify the quantification of a collection?
The type of a collection of a bunch of things
what about a sequence?
A, B, Q
Q, A, B
((x : T), (x)), A, B
quantify over side effects?
yes.
Q, A, B



(f (g (h ((x : T), x))))
so in this case the quantification is propagated
