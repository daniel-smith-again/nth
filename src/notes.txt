I'm making the nth implementation in two parts. 
There's the header-only library which implements the nth language, bytecode
interpreter, and other things.
Then there's the ".c" file which is operating-system specific.

The H file is responsible for...
- Parsing a UTF-8 string into an AST
- Interpreting the AST
- providing the nth defaults
- managing the live image state

The Cpp file is responsible for...
- the entry into the nth executable
- managing the frontend interface (i.e. how the user enters source code)
- providing memory management
- providing primitive routines necessary for nth to work
