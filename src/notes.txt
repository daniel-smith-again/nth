How do I make my bootstrap when everything is reprogrammable and also depends on
linking to a vendor library (or no library at all)?

Have a host profile.
The profile contains the information needed to make a process run on the system.
It includes 
            - CPU ISA description
            - Calling convention
            - Binary executable format(s) description
            - Necessary libraries which need to be included by the process.
This should all be static, searchable information.
It's used by an assembler/linker to generate native code.

What's the IR like?
* arbitrarily sized bits
* memory layout regex declaration
* no functions, just jumps
* ISA descriptor 
* CPU extension descriptor
* typed SSA registers, generic ops


API:

list_host_descriptors()
    get all descriptor strings for supported hosts

get_host_descriptor()
    get the descriptor string for the current host

list_architectures()
    get all descriptor strings for all architectures

get_architecture()
    get the descriptor string for the current architecture

list_ops()
    get all operations for the current host/architecture
