What is the type theory?

Type is an unindexed collection of unique values as members.
A Discrete Type has a cardinality.
A Continuous Type does not have a cardinality.


What can I do that lambda calculus and category theory can't do?
Lambda calculus can bind and apply.
Category theory can structure objects.
Both can be extended with types.

I need a way to talk about the "form" of a thing, and it's "impluse".
The actor model has internal state and message passing.
Lambda calculus has abstraction and application.
Category theory has objects and arrows.

Mathematics is great because you can write a notation for one thing and then 
use prose to instruct the reader to "user their imagination" with the rest.

No detail is unimportant.
Context matters.
At no point should you be "using your imagination".


So what is the "form" of a thing?
Does the form encapsulate? No. Physics doesn't encapsulate, it obscures by scale.
What does the form contain? Other forms.

What is the "impluse" of a thing?




What is this? A calculus, a model, or a theory? It's a theory.
You theorize using this thing to model your thought.
What is it?
Impulse Theory.
You have a component, with a form, and an impluse.
Given some impulses, a component will be at equilibrium.
How to notate this?

A name classifies one or more components.
A line denotes a form.
An arrow denotes an equilibrium.
