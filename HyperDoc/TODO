What are my image functions?
Given that images are bindings.

Load, Store, Extract, Open, Close, Define, List, This.

should autocomplete be a feature?
Yes, partial match of a transform should be available.

load will open an image from a system location
store will save an image to a system location
extract will create an artifact from an image
open will use a loaded image as the top-level
close will move outside the current top-level
list will create a listing of all the bindings in an image
the binding, this, refers to the current top-level


meta stuff:

describe will describe a unit
suggest will attempt to guess a complete transform expression from an incomplete expression.
