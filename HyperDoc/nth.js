--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This is a fully working implementation of the nth Programming Language     
     as described in "The nth Programming Language HyperDoc". It is a fully     
          conforming implementation as described in the "Conformance"           
                      section of the chapter, "Foreword".

                  The author(s) grants the holder of this work                  
             full right of access, without limitation, irrevocably,

           Authorship of this work is reserved only for contributions

             Contribution to this work under terms other than those             
                given in this section constitutes authorship of                 
                    a distinct and separate work, for which                     
                the status of authorship of this particular work                
                                is not granted.                                 

            In plain terms, if you, the rights holder of this work,

           you cannot claim that it is a form, version, or variation            
              of the work titled "The nth Programming Environment"              
         without providing it under the terms set out in this section.          

               The purpose of these terms is to provide the most                
               permissive rights and allowances while preventing                
                any individual or party from claiming authorship                
                          with less permissive rights                           
                and thus tainting the availability of the work.
