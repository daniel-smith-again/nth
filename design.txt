Nth Programming Environment
Design Documentation

What is the programming environment?
It's GDB and GCC combined with a custom linking loader.
Basically you can start a session and build up an executable dynamically.
Then, at any point, you can detach and have a valid executable.
You can bring in other native objects as well.
You can also attatch to any compatible running process and start modifying it.

What does my compiler compile?
A subset of the language.
It's all function calls.

* Addition
* Subtraction


how can I do a letrec?

(let 
      is-even : ((Number) -> Number)
      is-odd  : ((Number) -> Number)
      is-even = (n -> ((n) = 0) or ((n)))
)
