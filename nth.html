<h1>Standard Document<br>for<br>Nth</h1>
<p><cite id="0"><a href="#0">0</a></cite>
This document specifies a system for describing and computing programs called "Nth".
</p>
<p><cite id="1"><a href="#1">1</a></cite>
This document represents a standard. 
The descriptions therein represent requirements for an implementation of Nth. 
</p>
<p><cite id="1.1"><a href="#1.1">1.1</a></cite>
An implementation is said to be "conforming" if it behaves according to all requirements given in this standard.
</p>
<p>
There are two discrete components to the Nth system, the language and the computational environment.
In this document, "Nth" refers specifically to the language component and the environment is referred to by "environment".
</p>
<p>
Nth is a homoiconic language.
The written form of the language coresponds exactly to the literal structure representing the program.
</p>
<p>
The term "Program Model" refers to the cannonical representation of a program in Nth.
</p>
<p>
A written program is then homoiconic with the Program Model.
</p>
<p>
A written program is formed as a sequence of character values.
Nth minimally requires the characters provided by the ASCII character encoding scheme.
</p>
<p>
The character sequence is grouped into discrete tokens.
Tokens are either Symbols, Numbers, Blanks, or Punctuation.
</p>
<p>
A Symbol is a token which does not contain any Blanks or Punctuation.
</p>
<p>
A Number is a Symbol comprised of only the decimal digits, one of
<code>0123456789</code>
It may optionally contain some characters denoting rational values or exponents.
The program below quantifies the construction of all valid Number tokens.
<code></code>
