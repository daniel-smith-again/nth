The Prose Definition of Nth

   Nth is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language.
It includes facilities such as higher order functions, higher order modules, extended tagged sum types, arbitrary precision arithmetic, macros, and lexically delimited continuations.

Nth programs are stored and transmitted as UTF-8 encoded Unicode text.
Nth syntax is written and read from left-to-right. 
In order to eliminate conflicting Unicode representations of a program, Unicode code points are interpreted as syntax in the order in which they are received, regardless of any formatting modes which the code points may signify.

Programs are composed by a programmer or other agent via a Session abstraction.
A Session involves the agent submitting commands to the live Session process in order to inspect or modify the definitions of various entities.
These commands are represented as components of the Nth language and programs may be written which engage those commands as a result of being evaluated.
