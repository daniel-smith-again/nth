Standard Documentation for the nth Programming Language

0.	nth is a programming language and companion environment for writing and 
computing programs.

1.0	The nth language is written as a sequence of characters.

1.1	Characters are classified into three discrete groups, Glyphs, Digits, 
and Blanks.

1.1.0	Glyphs are any visible character written as a symbol.

1.1.1	Digits are specifically the ten decimal digits.

1.1.2	Blanks are any character which results in space between other 
characters.

1.2	Certain subsequences of characters are grouped into individual syntax 
components of a grammar.

1.2.0	The grammar is given below using a notation where an arrow, "->", 
represents a relationship where any sequence given right of the arrow can occur 
in a sequence where the name given left of the arrow occurs.

1.2.0.0	Names are two or more characters.

1.2.0.1	Multiple sequences given right of the arrow are separated with a line 
break.

1.2.0.2	Sequences that can repeat multiple times are followed by a star, "*".

1.2.0.3	Individual characters are given as themselves.

1.3	The grammar representing the syntax of all possible nth programs is as 
follows...
		Program ->	Expression 
				Sequence 
				Quote 
				Collection 
				Type 
				String
