                  What Problem am I Solving with My Language?                   
================================================================================

ALGOL style languages suck in general. 
Languages which try to break away from the ALGOL model are equally lacking.
This is because...

1.	The feedback cycle isn't instantaneous
2.	Every language assumes no others exist
3.	Constructs are inefficient for humans and sometimes even the computer too.
4.	You can't perform basic program validation in the language.
5.	You can't abstract or extend the language.



I solve these problems by providing...

*		Live, Session-based programming
		You should be able to ask high level questions about your program.
		
*		Extractable
		You should be able to take the program you built, and export it to some
		binary machine-interpreted format in a generic way.
		
*		It's up all the way down
		The language is the bottom, top, and every abstraction in-between.
		
*		Predictable Automatic Memory Management
		Callee cleanup and bump allocation as GC allows for crazy perf.
		
*		Types and Polymorphism
		The compiler doesn't have to guess about the shape of data.
		
*		Macros
		If you want to do compile-time stuff, just do it.
