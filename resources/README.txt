This folder contains various published and unpublished documents which I have collected over the years.
At some point in time, each of these documents was freely accessible and thus the copies present in this folder are copies of the freely accessible forms of these works.
According to fair-use, I can keep these for personal use and future reference.

I don't condone or encourage violating copyright laws.
If you believe that a clone of this folder being present on your computer violates some form of copyright, then by all means, please delete this folder.
